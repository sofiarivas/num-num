Ñom ñom..my recipe book app

I created this app to learn more about Flutter. I wanted to learn basic concept like:
- Stateless and Stateful widgets
- Navigation
- UI styling
- Firebase integration
- Flutter setup for Android and iOS

## Never heard about flutter?
**Out of the book definition:** Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a single codebase.

**On my experience:** Coming from only developing for the web, Flutter is a great tool to experiment building applications for other platforms that are new to me. And I am surprised of how easy it is to build great UIs with Flutter.

A few resources to get you started if you are interested in learning Flutter:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
